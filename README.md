# NeuralNetwork
Repository dedicated to my research of neural networks and the mathematics behind them.

## Function
The file NeuralNetwork.py contains the class that does everything. Currently, you can customize the entire network in terms of number of nodes and number of hidden layers, allowing for relatively versatile control. However, the only architecture available is a fully connected feedforward. This (obviously) limits the functionality, but for researching and applying the mathematics of stochastic gradient descent, it serves its purpose.
